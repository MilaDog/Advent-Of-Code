# Advent of Code

Welcome! Just a repo for all the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) questions that I have done :tada:

Solved using a variety of different languages, all found in the `src` directory. Each language is in its own folder.

## Problem Inputs

Breakdown on how to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/flwyd/adventofcode/blob/main/README.md).

1. Navigate to the `inputs` directory.
2. Place the problem's input in a folder following this naming scheme: `./inputs/<year>/<day>/input.txt`, eg: `.
/inputs/2025/01/input.txt`
